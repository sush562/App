# Cuisine Central

Cuisine Central is my personal pet project completely designed in React Native.
 
This app is merely a demo, having limited functionalities and features. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in designing and developing mobile applications in React Native.

Using this mobile app, a user is able to search various restaurants in any selected location. It displays a list of restaurants and user can view the restaurant details by selecting any restaurant on home page screen. 

You can download this via:
- Google Playstore: (Coming Soon)
- Amazon Playstore: (Coming Soon)
- Directly on phone: (You may need to allow access to outside applications in your android phone. Don't worry, my app has no malicious code or any other concern as such.)

### Credits

This app is powered by <a href="www.zomato.com">Zomato<a> APIs. I am thankful to their resources that helped me build this application.

Since their is a limit to api call placed by Zomato per day, this app is not meant for extensive usage as such.
