# Cuisine Central

Cuisine Central is my personal pet project completely designed in React Native.
 
This app is merely a demo, having limited functionalities and features. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in designing and developing mobile applications in React Native.

Using this mobile app, a user is able to search various restaurants in any selected location. It displays a list of restaurants and user can view the restaurant details by selecting any restaurant on home page screen. 

You can view the code <a href="https://github.com/sush562/App/tree/master/Cuisine_Central/Code/CuisineDemoApp">here</a> if you like.

**If you like my work, please give this a star from top right corner.**

### Credits

This app is powered by <a href="https://www.zomato.com/" target="_blank">Zomato<a> APIs. I am thankful to their resources that helped me build this application.

Since their is a limit to api call placed by Zomato per day, this app is not meant for extensive usage as such.
